# rafeyOS — Web based Linux + Mac OS

A terminal and an Ubuntu 24.04-style + Mac desktop that share one shell and one filesystem. Type commands at `/`, or point and click at `/os`. Projects open as a 3D scene. Everything you make stays in your browser.

**[Open rafeyOS](https://rafey.ai)** — the terminal is the front door; run `os` for the desktop

## Features

### Terminal

- Bash-like shell with pipes, `&&` `||` `;`, `>` `>>`, quotes, globs and `$VARS`
- 61 commands, each with `--help`; `man <command>` works too
- Tab completion, shared history and a built-in `nano`
- Pickers for projects and blog posts, and a music player with a story timeline

### Filesystem

- One virtual tree behind both the terminal and the desktop
- `/home/rafey` holds the portfolio, read-only
- `/home/visitor` is yours, saved to localStorage and synced across tabs
- New folder, rename, trash and restore; `/tmp` clears on reload

### Desktop

- GNOME 46 and Yaru replica: top bar, Activities overview, Quick Settings
- Window manager with drag, 8-way resize, edge snapping and maximize
- Dock with magnification, right-click menus and launch bounce
- Lock, suspend, restart, and log out back to the terminal
- Wallpapers and accent colours, from Settings or `gsettings`

### Built-in Applications

- **Files** — Nautilus-style browser with sidebar, path bar, search, rename and trash
- **Terminal** — the same shell as `/`, also on Ctrl+Alt+T
- **Text Editor** — writes into your home folder
- **Music** — Amberol-style player that keeps playing after you close it
- **Mail** — compose window that sends through your mail app
- **Projects** — five projects as wireframe shapes in a 3D scene
- **Settings** — appearance, dock, sound, notifications, and an About page for Rafey's hardware

## Quick Start

```console
visitor@rafey.ai:~$ ls /home/rafey
bio.txt  blog  contact  Music  projects  README.txt  skills.txt
visitor@rafey.ai:~$ echo "hi rafey" > ~/Desktop/hello.txt
→ visible in rafeyOS
visitor@rafey.ai:~$ os
```

`hello.txt` is now on the desktop. Run `projects --3d` for the 3D scene, or `help` for the rest.
